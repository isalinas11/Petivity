## Contribution Guidelines
==========================

First, go to the local directory where you wish the project to live.

Then, clone the project: 
git clone https://github.com/GetHub91/Petivity

Next, checkout a new branch doing `git checkout -b my-branch`

Check your staging area using 'git status'

Add your changes using `git add file.type`. 
Alternately, you can add your changes to the entire directory by doing 'git add .'

commit changes with a message for what you've done:
git commit -m "enter message here"
OR, 'git commit' and then write your message and save.

Push your changes to github using `git push --set-upstream origin my-branch`
You should be able to just use 'git push' from then on.

Go to the repository and open a pull request and let teammates comment and/or approve


Troubleshooting:
================

If you ever get the message, "fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git", then try adding a remote (repository):
git add remote origin https://github.com/GetHub91/Petivity

If you ever get the message, "fatal: pathspec 'remote' did not match any files", check if you already have a remote: 
git remote -v

If you ever want to get rid of a remote first check your remotes and try:
git remote rm [remote]
(usually, you would replace [remote] with origin, but not necessarily)
